# Citizen Cyberlab Analytics Tracker

The CCL-Tracker javascript library is used as the middleware "glue" between a javascript application and the analytics provider. It addresses the problem where it's difficult to track the user behaviour within complex javascript application, when the analytics code is hooked externally onto the application (ex. through Google Tag Manager).

In addition, it provides the necessary abstraction between the application developer and the analytics responsible, allowing the latter to chose the most appropriate tracking solution, even at a later time.
